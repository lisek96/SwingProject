# SwingProject
Swing project dedicated for a company that wants to control their magazines (naive application)


There is no database involved in this, data is stored in txt files and then an user can load data/save data, everything works locally, this is not a web application.
Java SE + Swing are only technologies used here. An user can add an item to magazine, delete an item, add a new item to database, he can add a new magazine, he can also check 
how % of a specic magazine is taken, he can also check what items are stored in specific magazine. Just basics usages. GUI is not very rich here but I think it's ENOUGH also have 
used GridBagLayout almost everywhere in this project so I haven't choosen an easy road to go! ;).


This is my last GUI project, I have tried Java FX but as I learned Swing I don't see reason to learn Java FX since I want to become an Web Developer and if I need a
desktop app I can write it in Swing and it's not a problem for me, I like this technology even tho people are complaining on it.


Project finished 06/2020



***This is not MVC project, I have created it after 6 months of learning Java but I am satisfied with it.
